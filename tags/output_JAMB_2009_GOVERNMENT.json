The real secession which was experienced in Nigeria was that of the then Eastern Region in the year 1967. The secession was as a result of the 1966 military coup which was followed by the pogrom that was perpetrated against the Igbos in the North.

Non-alignment is the idea or notion of a group of nations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Caribbean and Europe to be neutral in the cold war between the Western Capitalist and it Eastern Socialist powers.\n\nIt should be noted that many African countries have found it difficult to implement the principles of Non-alignment as required. This is mostly due to internal political problems which force them to look for aids and military assistance from either of the blocs. For instance Nigeria and Russia during Nigeria and Biafra war which in most cases referred to as Nigeria civil war."
