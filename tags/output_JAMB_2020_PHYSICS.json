Work done is given by the equation:\\(W = mgh\\)where \\(m\\) is the mass of water lifted, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\(h\\) is the vertical height. Given that the pump lifts 5000 kg of water through a vertical height of 60 m, we can plug these values into the equation:\\(W = (5000 \\, kg)(9.81 \\, m/s^2)(60 \\, m)\\)Calculate the work done:\\(W = 2.943 \\times 10^6 \\, J\\)Now, we need to find the power, which is the work done divided by the time taken:\\(P = \\frac{W}{t}\\)The time taken is given as 15 minutes. We must first convert this to seconds:\\(t = 15 \\, min \\times 60 \\, s/min = 900 \\, s\\)Now, divide the work done by the time taken to find the power:\\(P = \\frac{2.943 \\times 10^6 \\, J}{900 \\, s}\\)Calculate the power:\\(P = 3.27 \\times 10^3 \\, Js^{-1}\\)So, the power of the pump is approximately 3.3 \u00d7 103 Js-1, which is Option A.",
