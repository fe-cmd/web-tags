    "text": "A series RLC circuit is said to resonate, when",
    "explanation": "In a series RLC circuit, resonance occurs when the circuit's capacitive reactance and inductive reactance are equal, but have opposite signs. This means that they cancel each other out, and the only remaining opposition to current flow is the resistance (R) of the circuit. This leads to the minimum impedance and maximum current flow through the circuit. So, the correct answer is Option D: impedance is minimum.The impedance (Z) of a series RLC circuit is given by the formula:\\[\\text{Z} = \\sqrt{R^2 + (\\text{X}_\\text{L} - \\text{X}_\\text{C})^2}\\]Where R is the resistance, \\(\\text{X}_\\text{L}\\) is the inductive reactance, and \\(\\text{X}_\\text{C}\\) is the capacitive reactance. At resonance, \\(\\text{X}_\\text{L} = \\text{X}_\\text{C}\\), so the impedance is equal to the resistance:\\[\\text{Z} = \\text{R}\\]Since the impedance is at its minimum value, the current flowing through the circuit is at its maximum. This is because the current is inversely proportional to the impedance:\\[\\text{I} = \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{Z}}\\]Where I is the current and V is the voltage across the circuit.Resonance in RLC circuits is important in various applications such as tuning radio receivers, filtering signals, and designing oscillators. By understanding the conditions for resonance and how it affects the circuit's behavior, engineers can design more efficient and effective electronic devices.",

    "text": "Calculate the work done in charging a capacitor of capacitance 20\u00b5F through a potential difference of 1000V.",
    "explanation": "To calculate the work done in charging a capacitor, we can use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:\\(W = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2\\)where \\(W\\) is the work done (or energy stored), \\(C\\) is the capacitance, and \\(V\\) is the potential difference across the capacitor.In this problem, we are given the capacitance \\(C = 20\\,\\text{\u00b5F}\\) and the potential difference \\(V = 1000\\,\\text{V}\\). We can plug these values into the formula:\\(W = \\frac{1}{2}(20\\,\\text{\u00b5F})(1000\\,\\text{V})^2\\)However, we need to convert the capacitance from microfarads (\u00b5F) to farads (F) before performing the calculation. We can do this by multiplying the capacitance by \\(10^{-6}\\) (since there are \\(10^6\\) \u00b5F in 1 F):\\(C = 20\\,\\text{\u00b5F} \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{F/\u00b5F} = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{F}\\)Now we can plug the converted capacitance into the formula:\\(W = \\frac{1}{2}(20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{F})(1000\\,\\text{V})^2\\)Calculating the work done, we get:\\(W = \\frac{1}{2}(20 \\times 10^{-6})(1000)^2 = 10\\,\\text{J}\\)So, the work done in charging the capacitor is 10 J, which corresponds to Option E.",

    "explanation": "First, let's understand the electromagnetic spectrum, which is the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. These types of radiation are arranged in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength.Now, let's arrange the given options in the order of their increasing frequency:Radio waves (III): These have the longest wavelength and the lowest frequency among the options given. They are used for communication, such as in radio and television broadcasts.Infrared radiation (IV): Infrared radiation has a higher frequency than radio waves but a lower frequency than visible light. It is emitted by warm objects, such as the human body, and is used in remote controls and thermal imaging cameras.Visible light (I): This is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that humans can see. It has a higher frequency than infrared radiation and a lower frequency than ultraviolet radiation.Ultraviolet radiation (V): Ultraviolet radiation has a higher frequency than visible light but a lower frequency than X-rays. It is responsible for causing sunburn and can also be used to sterilize surfaces.Gamma rays (II): These have the highest frequency and the shortest wavelength among the options given. They are produced by nuclear reactions and are used in cancer treatment and astronomical observations.So, the correct order of increasing frequency is Radio waves (III), Infrared radiation (IV), Visible light (I), Ultraviolet radiation (V), and Gamma rays (II). This corresponds to Option E.",

    "text": "Electric charges on the surface of a conductor would be most evenly distributed if the shape of the conductor is",
    "explanation": "Electric charges on the surface of a conductor tend to distribute themselves evenly to minimize the potential energy of the system. This distribution is affected by the shape of the conductor, as the charges tend to move to areas with the least curvature.In a cylindrical conductor, the curvature is constant along the length of the cylinder, which allows the charges to distribute evenly. If you compare this to a conical, parabolic or cubical shape, you can see that there are areas with higher curvature, such as edges or vertices, where charges would be more concentrated.Although a spherical conductor would also have an even distribution of charges on its surface, the question specifically asks for the shape with the most even distribution. Since the curvature of a cylindrical conductor is less than that of a spherical conductor, the charges will be more evenly distributed on a cylindrical conductor. Hence, the correct answer is Option C: cylindrical.It's important to remember that the distribution of charges on a conductor is a fundamental concept in electrostatics and can be applied to solve problems related to electric fields, potential, and capacitance.",

    "explanation": "First, we need to consider two processes in the given question: the cooling of boiling water to 0\u00b0C and the change of state from water to ice at 0\u00b0C.Step 1: Cooling of boiling water to 0\u00b0CTo calculate the heat energy lost during this process, we can use the formula:\\(Q = mc\u0394T\\)  Where:\\(Q\\) = heat energy (Joules)\\(m\\) = mass of water (grams)\\(c\\) = specific heat capacity of water (4.2 Jg-1 K-1)\\(\u0394T\\) = change in temperature (100\u00b0C - 0\u00b0C = 100\u00b0C)Plugging in the values: \\(Q = (10g)(4.2 Jg^{-1}K^{-1})(100K)\\)  Q = 4200JStep 2: Change of state from water to ice at 0\u00b0CNow, we need to calculate the heat energy lost during the change of state.
