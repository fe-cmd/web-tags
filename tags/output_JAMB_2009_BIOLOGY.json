The swelling from meningitis typically triggers signs and symptoms such as headache, fever and a stiff neck.\nSome fungal infections are transmitted by airborne dust particles. In addition, other types of meningitis can be transferred to humans by vectors such as\u00a0mosquitoes\n(for example, West Nile virus) or ticks (Lyme disease).\nThe bacteria that cause meningitis are transmitted\u00a0from person-to-person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions from carriers.
