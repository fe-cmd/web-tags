      "text": "Explanation\n\u201cHistoric\u201d\n\n\u201cHistoric\u201d is an adjective that means something important or influential in history. So Denise should say, \u201cThe treaty was a historic occasion.\u201d It was an important occasion. It would be incorrect to say, \u201cWe sell historic replicas\u201d unless they are replicas that are important to history. You\u2019ve probably heard TV announcers refer to \u201chistoric treaties\u201d or perhaps you\u2019ve visited some \u201chistoric houses\u201d or \u201chistoric battlefields.\u201d All of these were important or famous things in history\n\n\u201cHistorical\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorical,\u201d on the other hand, is an adjective that refers to anything from the past, important or not. Denise should say, \u201cWe sell historical replicas\u201d because these replicas are from the past; they\u2019re probably not so important. A \u201chistorical occasion\u201d would be just some occasion in the past; it wasn\u2019t necessarily an important occasion. \u201cHistorical documents\u201d are just documents that record the past. You\u2019ve probably read a \u201chistorical novel\u201d or perhaps even a \u201chistorical romance,\u201d which are books set in the past. There is nothing especially important about these books; if they were, they\u2019d be \u201chistoric books.\u201d The Gutenberg Bible would be a historic book, for example.\n\nMemory Tricks\n\nIt\u2019s common for people to mix these two words up. One style guide laments, \u201cExamples of \u2018historic\u2019 used incorrectly for \u2018historical\u2019 could easily run for several pages\u201d (2). William Safire said something that might help you remember the difference: \u201cAny past event is historical, but only the most memorable ones are historic\u201d"
