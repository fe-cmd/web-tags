    "explanation": "When aluminium metal reacts with hot concentrated tetraoxosulphate(VI) acid (also known as sulfuric acid, H2SO4), it forms aluminium sulphate (Al2(SO4)3), water (H2O), and sulfur dioxide gas (SO2). To find the correct balanced equation for this reaction, we need to make sure that the number of atoms of each element on the reactants side is equal to the number of atoms of the same element on the products side.Option A is the correct balanced equation:2Al(s) + 6H2SO4(1) \\(\\to\\) Al2(SO4)3(aq) + 6H2O(1) + 3SO2(g)Let's verify this by counting the atoms on both sides of the equation:Aluminium (Al): 2 atoms on the reactants side and 2 atoms on the products side.Hydrogen (H): 12 atoms on the reactants side (6 x 2) and 12 atoms on the products side (6 x 2).Sulfur (S): 6 atoms on the reactants side (6 x 1) and 6 atoms on the products side (3 x 1 + 3 x 2).Oxygen (O): 24 atoms on the reactants side (6 x 4) and 24 atoms on the products side (6 x 4 + 3 x 2).As the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides of the equation, Option A is the correct balanced equation for this reaction.",

    "explanation": "The question is asking about the substance that gives unripe oranges their sour taste. The options provided are Alkene, Alkanol, Alkanoic acid, and Alkanoate. To answer the question, we need to understand what each of these substances is and how they relate to the taste of oranges.An alkene is a hydrocarbon with at least one double bond between carbon atoms. Alkenes do not have a sour taste, so we can eliminate option A.An alkanol is an alcohol, which is a type of organic compound that contains a hydroxyl (-OH) group. While some alcohols have a distinct taste and smell, they do not give oranges their sour taste. Therefore, we can eliminate option B.An alkanoate is an ester, which is a compound formed by the reaction of an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. Alkanoates do not have a sour taste, so we can eliminate option D.This leaves us with option C, alkanoic acid, as the correct answer. Alkanoic acids are carboxylic acids that have a sour taste and are responsible for the sour taste of unripe oranges. When an orange ripens, the concentration of alkanoic acid decreases, and the fruit becomes less sour.In summary, the substance responsible for the sour taste of unripe oranges is alkanoic acid, which is option C.",

Saponification is the process of making soap by reacting a fat or oil with a strong alkali, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. In this case, palm oil is the fat, and sodium hydroxide is the strong alkali.Palm oil consists of triglycerides, which are esters formed from glycerol and fatty acids. In the saponification reaction, the triglycerides in the palm oil react with the sodium hydroxide to form glycerol and sodium salts of fatty acids (soap).The other options listed are not applicable in this case:Esterification is the process of forming esters from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, which is not applicable here as the reaction involves breaking down the ester bonds in the triglycerides.Neutralization occurs when an acid reacts with a base to form a salt and water, which is not applicable here since palm oil is not an acid.Polymerization is the process of forming large molecules called polymers by joining smaller molecules called monomers, which is not occurring in this reaction.In summary, when concentrated sodium hydroxide solution is added to palm oil, the saponification reaction takes place, forming soap and glycerol as the products.",

    "text": "A substance which dissolves readily in organic solvent would",
    "explanation": "This question is asking about a substance that dissolves easily in organic solvents. Organic solvents are solvents made up of carbon and hydrogen atoms, such as ethanol or acetone. The question is asking which option is correct.The correct option is A, which states that the substance is a covalent compound. Covalent compounds are made up of non-metal atoms that share electrons to form a bond. These compounds tend to dissolve easily in organic solvents because they are non-polar, which means that they do not have a positive or negative charge.Option B, which states that the substance has strong electrostatic forces of attraction, is incorrect. This is because substances with strong electrostatic forces of attraction tend to be ionic compounds, which are made up of metal and non-metal atoms. These compounds do not dissolve easily in organic solvents because they are polar, which means that they have a positive and negative charge.Option C, which states that the substance has a high melting point, is also incorrect. Melting point is the temperature at which a solid substance turns into a liquid. While substances with high melting points tend to be solids, this does not necessarily mean that they do not dissolve easily in organic solvents.Option D, which states that the substance conducts electricity in a molten state, is also incorrect. This is because substances that conduct electricity in a molten state tend to be ionic compounds, which, as mentioned earlier, do not dissolve easily in organic solvents.In summary, the correct option is A, which states that the substance that dissolves easily in organic solvents is a covalent compound.

    "explanation": "A saturated solution is a solution that has dissolved the maximum amount of solute at a given temperature. In a saturated solution, there is an equilibrium between the dissolved solute and the undissolved solute. This equilibrium is affected by various factors, including temperature.When the temperature of a saturated solution changes, it disturbs this equilibrium between the dissolved and undissolved solute. If the temperature increases, the solubility of the solute usually increases, meaning that more solute can dissolve in the solvent. This causes the equilibrium to shift towards the dissolved solute. Conversely, if the temperature decreases, the solubility of the solute usually decreases, meaning that less solute can dissolve in the solvent. This causes the equilibrium to shift towards the undissolved solute.Option C, which states that the equilibrium between the dissolved solute and the undissolved solute is disturbed, is the correct answer. It's important to note that the equilibrium between the solute and solvent is not directly affected by temperature changes. Instead, the equilibrium between the dissolved and undissolved solute is disturbed, which in turn affects the overall solubility of the solute in the solvent.",

In such reactions, the energy required to break the bonds of the reactants is greater than the energy released by the formation of the products.In this case, the correct answer is Option C: Heat content of reactants is less than the heat content of products. This means that the heat energy absorbed by the reaction is used to increase the heat content of the products, making them higher than the initial heat content of the reactants.It is important to note that an endothermic reaction does not necessarily mean that the reaction is non-spontaneous, as stated in Option D.

    "explanation": "An atom's atomic number represents the number of protons it has in its nucleus. In this case, the atomic number is 13, which means the atom has 13 protons. Since the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in a neutral atom, this atom also has 13 electrons.To determine the number of orbits (also called electron shells or energy levels) in an atom, we can use the electron configuration. The electron configuration is the distribution of electrons in the atom's energy levels. The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in each energy level follows the 2n2 rule, where n is the energy level number.For the atom with atomic number 13, we can distribute the 13 electrons across the energy levels as follows:1st energy level (n = 1): 2 electrons (2 * 12 = 2)2nd energy level (n = 2): 8 electrons (2 * 22 = 8)3rd energy level (n = 3): 3 electrons (13 - 2 - 8 = 3)As we can see, the electrons fill up three energy levels. Therefore, an atom with atomic number 13 has 3 orbits (Option D).",

    "explanation": "The shape of a water molecule (H2O) is non-linear.Water molecules consist of one oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The oxygen atom is at the center, while the hydrogen atoms are located on the sides. Due to the presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom, the electron repulsion causes the hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen (H-O-H) bond angle to be approximately 104.5 degrees, making the shape of the molecule bent or non-linear.In contrast, other molecular geometries, such as octahedral, pyramidal, and tetrahedral, have different arrangements of atoms and bond angles. For instance, a tetrahedral molecule has a central atom bonded to four other atoms with bond angles of about 109.5 degrees.To better understand molecular geometry, consider studying Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, which helps predict the shapes of molecules based on the repulsion between electron pairs surrounding a central atom.",

    "text": "A metallic ion Z\n2+\n with an inert gas structure contains 18 electrons. How many protons are contained in this ion?",
    "explanation": "Let's start by understanding what the question tells us. A metallic ion Z2+ has an inert gas structure and contains 18 electrons. We need to find out the number of protons in this ion.Inert gas structure means that the ion has a stable electron configuration similar to that of inert gases (noble gases) such as helium, neon, argon, etc. These elements have a full outer electron shell, making them very stable and unreactive. This ion has lost 2 electrons to achieve this stable configuration, which is why it has a 2+ charge.Now, let's recall some basic atomic structure concepts. The atomic number (Z) of an element represents the number of protons in its nucleus. In a neutral atom, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. In an ion, however, the number of electrons can be different from the number of protons due to the loss or gain of electrons.In this case, the ion Z2+ has lost 2 electrons to achieve its inert gas structure. Therefore, the original neutral atom must have had the same number of protons as the ion has electrons plus the 2 lost electrons. So, the number of protons is 18 (electrons in the ion) + 2 (lost electrons) = 20 protons.So, the correct answer is Option A: 20.",
