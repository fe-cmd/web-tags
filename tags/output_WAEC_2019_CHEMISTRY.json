It is necessary because molecules need to overcome a certain energy barrier to break existing bonds and form new ones during a reaction.Bond energy, on the other hand, is the energy required to break a particular chemical bond between atoms in a molecule, and it is not directly related to the energy needed for a reaction to occur.Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion, and while it plays a role in chemical reactions, it is not the minimum energy required for effective collisions between reacting particles.Potential energy is stored energy in an object due to its position, and it also does not directly relate to the energy needed for a reaction to occur.In summary, activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required for effective collisions between reacting particles, which is necessary to initiate a chemical reaction.",

Ionic bond (Electrovalent bond): This bond is formed when one atom transfers one or more electrons to another atom, resulting in the formation of oppositely charged ions that are attracted to each other.3.

    "explanation": "The question is asking about the law that is illustrated by the formation of the oxides of an element X. The three oxides are X2O, XO, and XO2. The options to choose from are conservation of mass, definite proportion, mass action, and multiple proportion.The law of definite proportion states that in any given chemical compound, the elements are always present in the same proportion by mass. This law doesn't apply here because the compounds being referred to are not necessarily the same compound, but different oxides of the same element.The law of conservation of mass states that mass cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, but it is conserved. This law doesn't apply here because no chemical reaction is mentioned, just the formation of different oxides.The law of mass action describes the way that the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants. This law doesn't apply here because there is no mention of a chemical reaction or reaction rate.The correct answer is the law of multiple proportion. This law states that when two elements form different compounds, the ratio of the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element is in small whole numbers. This law is illustrated in this question because the element X is forming different oxides with oxygen, and the ratios of the masses of X to oxygen in the different oxides are in small whole number ratios, such as 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1.So, the correct answer is option D, the law of multiple proportion.",
