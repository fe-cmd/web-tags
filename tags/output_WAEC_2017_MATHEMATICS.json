    "explanation": "Let's start by looking at the given expression: \\(32x^2y - x^3y^3\\).The first step in factorizing this expression is to identify the common factors in both terms. We can see that both terms have x and y as common factors. In fact, the least power of x in both terms is \\(x^2\\) and the least power of y in both terms is y. So, we can factor out \\(x^2y\\).When we factor out \\(x^2y\\), the expression becomes: \\(x^2y(32 - xy^2)\\).Now, let's examine the remaining expression inside the parentheses: \\(32 - xy^2\\). We can further factor out a constant from the first term. Since 32 is divisible by 16, we can rewrite the expression as:\\(x^2y(16(2 - \\frac{1}{16}xy^2))\\).Finally, we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses by multiplying the factor 16 with both terms:\\(16x^2y(2 - 3xy^2)\\).Comparing our result with the given options, we can see that our factorization matches Option A: 16x2y(2 - 3xy2), which is the correct answer.The other options are incorrect because they either don't have the correct common factors or they aren't completely factorized.",

    "text": "If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are variables and \\(k\\) is a constant, which of the following describes an inverse relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)?",
    "explanation": "In order to understand the concept of an inverse relationship between two variables, let's first define what it means. In an inverse relationship, when one variable increases, the other variable decreases, and vice versa. This is different from a direct relationship, where both variables increase or decrease together.The correct answer is Option B: \\(y = \\frac{k}{x}\\). This equation represents an inverse relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), because as \\(x\\) increases, the value of \\(y\\) decreases, and as \\(x\\) decreases, the value of \\(y\\) increases. The constant \\(k\\) is a proportionality constant that determines the rate at which the relationship changes.Now let's explain why the other options are incorrect:Option A: \\(y = kx\\) - This equation represents a direct relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), because as \\(x\\) increases or decreases, \\(y\\) will also increase or decrease respectively.Option C: \\(y = k\\sqrt{x}\\) - This equation does not represent an inverse relationship because as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) will also increase, but at a decreasing rate. It is neither a direct nor an inverse relationship.Option D: \\(y = x + k\\) - This equation represents a linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), with \\(k\\) being the constant term. As \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) will also increase, but at a constant rate. This is not an inverse relationship.In summary, an inverse relationship between two variables is represented by the equation \\(y = \\frac{k}{x}\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant. This means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, and vice versa.",
