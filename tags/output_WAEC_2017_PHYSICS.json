    "explanation": "A beta particle forms when a neutron changes into a proton and a high-energy electron. The proton stays in the nucleus but the electron leaves the atom as a beta particle. When a nucleus emits a beta particle, these changes happen:the mass number stays the samethe atomic number increases by 1the nuclear charge increases by 1NB: Usually gold is created from platinum, which has one less proton than gold, or from mercury, which has one more proton than gold. Bombarding a platinum or mercury nucleus with neutrons can knock off an neutron or add on a neutron, which through natural radioactive decay can lead to gold.",

    "explanation": "A p-type semiconductor is a type of semiconductor material that has been doped with impurities that introduce an excess of 'holes.' Holes are locations in the material where an electron is missing, and they can be thought of as positive charge carriers. The process of adding impurities to a semiconductor is called doping, and the impurities themselves are called dopants.In a p-type semiconductor, the correct answer is that holes are the majority charge carriers (Option D). This is because the dopants added to the material have one less electron in their outer shell compared to the semiconductor atoms. As a result, they create an excess of holes in the material, making holes the majority charge carriers.It's important to note that the other options are not accurate for a p-type semiconductor. In Option A, the number of holes is not equal to the number of electrons; there are more holes than electrons. In Option B, the electrical resistivity does not necessarily increase; doping can reduce the overall resistivity of the material because it increases the number of available charge carriers. And in Option C, electrons are not the majority charge carriers in a p-type semiconductor; they are the majority charge carriers in an n-type semiconductor, which is doped with different impurities.To summarize, in a p-type semiconductor, holes are the majority charge carriers due to the presence of dopants that introduce an excess of holes in the material.",
