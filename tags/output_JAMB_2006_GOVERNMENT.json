Impartiality\nThe Civil Service and civil servants are expected to serve any government or political party in power without fear or favour. They should then not allow their political interest to becloud their faithfulness.\n\n5. Anonymity\nThe Civil Servants are anonymous, they are therefore seen but do not speak to the press unless authorized by the Minister. They do not disclose official secrets. \n\n6. Merits \nRecruitment into the Civil Service should be based on merit and not on quota or favouritism. This is for them to perform their functions very well and ensure the success of the government."

      "text": "Explanation\nKari Marx was one of the greatest advocates of Socialism.\n\nSocialism may be defined as a social, economic and political system in which the state owns and controls the means of production, exchange and distribution of goods and services. The main aim of Socialism is to ensure equal distribution of the nation's wealth.\n\nCountries that practice this economic system (known as the Second World) \nInclude:\n\n1. Russia\n\n2. Caechoslovakia\n\n3. Bulgaria\n\n4. China\n\n5. Cuba\n\n6. Romania\n\n7. Albania\n\n8. Poland\n\n9. The German Democratic Republic.\n\nSome African countries that have also practised this system at one time or the other include:\n\n1. Tanzania\n\n2. Ethiopia\n\n3. Angola\n\n4. Burkina Faso\n\n5. Guinea\n\n6. Mozambique etc.\n\nSocialist economy is based on the central planning of all economic activities as opposed to the capitalist market price mechanism otherwise called capitalism.\n\nKari Marx, a German (1818 - 1883) was the founder and propounder of modern socialism.\n\nThe collaborator of Kari Marx in developing modern socialism was Friedrich Engels (1882-1895).\n\nVladimer Lenin led his Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Party (now known as the Communist Party of Russia) to carry out the Socialist Revolution. That was in 1917 in the defunct Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR)"
